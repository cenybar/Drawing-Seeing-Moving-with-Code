#Project 3

####[Brendan Rooney](http://www.brendan-rooney.com/), Letters from Strangers.   
The goal of this project was to create a site that could serve a therapeutic function for the user. The inspiration from this site came from a personal desire to shout into the void, but know that my message would be read somewhere down the line anonymously. On entering the site, users are given four options of emotions to pick from: happy, sad, anxious, calm. The site uses socket.io and node.js to store userinputted text in a JSON file, which is tagged with the chosen emotion of the user who wrote it. Using this data, users are “matched” by randomly assigning a usercontributed text that complements the emotion that the current user picked happy to sad, anxious to calm which is then revealed character by character as the user inputs their text.

####Nick Feuer, SpazSnake.   
SpazSnake is a multi-user online game of snake.  Each user is allocated a color and attempts to control the snake directing it to eat the food of their color. However the snake responds to instructions sent to it by all users in the order it receives these instructions. In this way, each user has to compete or collaborate to try and control the snake.
