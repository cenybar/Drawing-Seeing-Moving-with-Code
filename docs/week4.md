#Getting started with Vectors.
We will be drawing heavily on [Nature of Code.](http://natureofcode.com/) for the next part of the course.

Ensure you have done the Walker class exercises from last week. I.1, I.2 and I.3 (try some more examples in this chapter if you can)

This week's homework will be to begin with the concept of vectors.

##Vectors
Watch the following videos, doing the examples in p5js as you go along. The video's are described using Processing but the concept of Vectors are universal.
If you need to see the p5js example sketches they are here in [this repository.](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js/tree/master/chp01_vectors)

* 1.1 [Vectors (The Nature of Code)](https://vimeo.com/58734251)
* 1.2 [1.2 PVector class (The Nature of Code)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nTLzLf7jUg) Remember we are using p5js. So you will be using the [p5js pVector class.](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Vector)

*Do exercises 1.1 and 1.2 from the book in p5js (you can do 1.3 if you are excited and familiar with 3D)*

* 1.3 [1.3 Vector Math (The Nature of Code)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6b1_3bNCxk)
* 1.4 [1.4 Vector Math II (Nature of Code)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHusbFmq-4I)
* 1.5 [1.5 Acceleration (The Nature of Code)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ_WZU5s_VA&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZwSmtE13iJBcoI-r4y7iEc&index=5)

* Do exercise 1.4 and 1.5 in p5js.*
