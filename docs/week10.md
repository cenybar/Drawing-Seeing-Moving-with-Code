#Computer Vision Tutorial

##CLM Tracker Library
* We will be experimenting with a JS face tracker library called CLM tracker in combination with p5js. [The repository for the library can be found here.](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr) 
* If you are interested in a technical description and some of the math behind the library, here is a [description of how the CLM tracker works.](http://auduno.com/post/61888277175/fitting-faces)
* Several example have been added to the class folder, thanks to Lauren McCarthy who prepared them. A zip of these can be [downloaded here.](https://github.com/tegacodes/Drawing-Seeing-Moving-with-Code/blob/gh-pages/code/910-faceTracker.zip) 

#Deliverables
* Reading: Golan Levin, 2006. [Computer Vision for Artists and Designers: Pedagogic Tools and Techniques for Novice Programmers](http://www.flong.com/texts/essays/essay_cvad/)
* Develop a final project idea for this class. Prepare a 3 minute presentation describing what you will explore, what questions your project is exploring and what techniques you will use.
* Create a face puppet (or do another face as interface project of your choosing!). A face puppet is an animated puppet that you can control with your face. Be creative! Your mission is to make something unexpected and surprising. See the video below for an example student response to this project.
