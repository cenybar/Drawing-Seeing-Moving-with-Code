##Assignment 2A
*Weeks (6-10).*  
*Part 1: March 28th, start of class.*  
*Part 2: March 4th.*

###Artificial Life and Simulation
Create a virtual ecosystem that is inhabited by at least two different types of organisms. These organisms should have different appearances and different ways of moving. They may also interact or have particular behaviors. They may live, die, sleep, reproduce, eat each other or do any number of other things. Your ecosystem may also have abiotic (not living) components or it could have two or more environments within it that produce different drag forces on your creatures ([see example 2.05](https://github.com/tegacodes/Drawing-Seeing-Moving-with-Code/tree/gh-pages/code/Complete-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js-master/chp02_forces/NOC_2_05_fluidresistance)). You may decide to research a particular real ecosystem, an specific species, or a site from a text or film for inspiration for this project, for example creating a part of [Henry David Thoreau's Waldren pond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden_Pond) or looking at a species such as [e-coli's appearance](https://www.google.com/search?q=e+coli&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAppasra3LAhWHGx4KHdj4BY8Q_AUICCgC&biw=1016&bih=657#tbm=isch&q=e+coli+under+microscope) and [behavior for inspiration.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea1GRCW4pFM)

Each species of organism is to be a different Javascript object, so your code will have at least two different objects. 

####Deliverables:   

**Part 1:** 

* A basic version of your ecosystem is due at the start of class on March 28th. Your ecosystem must have at least two virtual creatures with unique appearances, movements and behaviors. 
* Upload your code to your student folder in your github repository by the start of class.
* Be ready to work with this Part 1 version of your assignment in class in March 28th with guest artists Sam Lavigne

**Part 2:**

* Complete the live web version of your ecosystem adding your additional behaviors, interactions and user inputs. 
* Submit a zip folder of your ecosystem code to the Moodle dropbox.
* Ensure that your ecosystems code is also uploaded to your student folder on your github repository. 
* Make a documentation post (a .md file) in your github repository with a link to your final project online, along with the project description. Give your ecosystem a title and write a description of your project concept. You should name and describe each species and including several screenshots of your final project. This post should also have a bibliography listing any references you may have used in the making of this project.
