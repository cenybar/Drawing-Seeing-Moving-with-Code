##Assignment 2
*Weeks (6-10)*

###Artificial Life and Simulation
Create a virtual ecosystem that is inhabited by at least two different types of organisms. These organisms should have different appearances and different ways of moving. They may also interact or have particular behaviors. Your ecosystem may also have abiotic (not living) components. It may have two or more environments within it that produce different drag forces on your creatures ([see example 2.05](https://github.com/tegacodes/Drawing-Seeing-Moving-with-Code/tree/gh-pages/code/Complete-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js-master/chp02_forces/NOC_2_05_fluidresistance)). You may decide to choose a particular ecosystem, a real species, a site from a text or film for inspiration for this project, for example creating a part of [Henry David Thoreau's Waldren pond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden_Pond) or looking at [e-coli appearance and behavior for inspiration.](https://www.google.com/search?q=e+coli&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAppasra3LAhWHGx4KHdj4BY8Q_AUICCgC&biw=1016&bih=657#tbm=isch&q=e+coli+under+microscope) 

Each species of organism is to be a different Javascript object, so your code will have at least two different objects. Your organisms may live, die, sleep, reproduce, eat each other or do any number of other things.

Deliverables:

* Submit a zip folder of your ecosystem code to the Moodle dropbox.
* Ensure that your ecosystems code is also uploaded to your student folder on your github repository. 
* Make a .md file in your github repository and post your project description. Give your ecosystem a title and write a description of your concept. You should name and introduce each species including several screenshots of your final project. This post should also have a bibliography listing any references you may have used in the making of this project.
