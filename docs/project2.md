##Assignment 2A and 2B
*Weeks (6-10).*  
*Part 1: March 28th, start of class.*  
*Part 2: March 8th 5pm.*

###Artificial Life and Simulation
Create a virtual ecosystem that is inhabited by at least two different types of organisms. These organisms should have different appearances and different ways of moving. They may also interact or have particular behaviors. They may live, die, sleep, reproduce, eat each other or do any number of other things. Your ecosystem may also have abiotic (not living) components or it could have two or more environments within it that produce different drag forces on your creatures ([see example 2.05](https://github.com/tegacodes/Drawing-Seeing-Moving-with-Code/tree/gh-pages/code/Complete-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js-master/chp02_forces/NOC_2_05_fluidresistance)). You may decide to research a particular real ecosystem, an specific species, or a site from a text or film for inspiration for this project, for example creating a part of [Henry David Thoreau's Waldren pond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden_Pond) or looking at a species such as [e-coli's appearance](https://www.google.com/search?q=e+coli&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAppasra3LAhWHGx4KHdj4BY8Q_AUICCgC&biw=1016&bih=657#tbm=isch&q=e+coli+under+microscope) and [behavior for inspiration.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea1GRCW4pFM)

Each species of organism is to be a different Javascript object, so your code will have at least two different objects.

####Deliverables:   

**Part 1:**

* A basic version of your ecosystem is due at the start of class on March 28th. Your ecosystem must have at least two virtual creatures with unique appearances, movements and behaviors.
* Upload your code to your student folder in your github repository by the start of class.
* Be ready to work with this Part 1 version of your assignment in class in March 28th with guest artists Sam Lavigne

**Part 2:**

* Complete the final version of your ecosystem, you may want to consider incorporating live web features, additional behaviors, interactions and user inputs to your ecosystem.
* You must deploy your p5 sketch online to a heroku instance or equivalent. To submit your code you can EITHER post all your code to your github repo and send me a link to it. Or zip all your code and files into a zip folder and submit to class Moodle assignment box.
* Documentation: To explain your project you are to either make a github markdown page or a pdf document that describes your project. This page should include. A title, your name, a description of what happens in your program, a short paragraph of the challenges/surprises your faced in the process, a list of the different species in your system, and at least 3 screen shots showing the evolution of your system. Add captions to these screen shots. This document should also have a link to a live version of this project online and a bibliography listing any references you may have used in the making of this project.
* If you are using github for submissions, add this markdown file as a README.md to your project repository and add to your own course repository online. If you are submitting via Moodle, add your file to your project folder. Zip up the folder and upload to the class Moodle, labelling with your name and Assig2A
