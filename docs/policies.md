#Course Policies

##Attendance

Miss 4 classes and you automatically fail. This is not negotiable.   
Miss 3 classes and lose a grade (so A+ goes to A etc). Come to class late – after 8.45 or leave early – before 11.55 and that counts as half an absence.  

##Accommodations

Students with documented physical, learning, and psychological and other disabilities are entitled to receive reasonable accommodations. If a student needs accommodations, he/she must first register with the Office of Access and Accommodations at 914 251-6035 or cou.accommodations@purchase.edu

##Grades

20% Final Assignment (weeks 11-14)
10% Discovery and research exercises
