#Computer Vision Tutorial

##CLM Tracker Library
* We will be experimenting with a JS face tracker library called CLM tracker in combination with p5js. [The repository for the library can be found here.](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr) 
* If you are interested in a technical description and some of the math behind the library, here is a [description of how the CLM tracker works.](http://auduno.com/post/61888277175/fitting-faces)
* Several example have been added to the class folder, thanks to Lauren McCarthy who prepared them. A zip of these can be downloaded here. 

#Deliverables
* Reading: Golan Levin, 2006. [Computer Vision for Artists and Designers: Pedagogic Tools and Techniques for Novice Programmers](http://www.flong.com/texts/essays/essay_cvad/)
* Create a face puppet (or another face as interface project of your choosing!)
* Develop a final project idea for this class. Prepare a 3 minute presentation describing what you will explore, what questions your project is exploring and what techniques you use.
