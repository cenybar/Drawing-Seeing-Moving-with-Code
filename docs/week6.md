* Reading: Select a talk from an [Eyeo festival speaker.](https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival/videos) You are to research the artist's work, what tools they use, what is their background
and focus. Write a research and discovery post on this person and their work including at least one image and link to a project. If you 
are stuck on who to choose, these talks are great:  

* [Robert Hodgin's talk from Eyeo.](https://vimeo.com/103537259)
* [Marias Watz on Algorithms](https://vimeo.com/46903693)
* [James George on experimental cameras and capture](https://vimeo.com/134973504)
* [Leah Buechley on tools, physical computing and making](https://vimeo.com/110616469)
* [Allison Parish on bots, and generative text](https://vimeo.com/134734729)
