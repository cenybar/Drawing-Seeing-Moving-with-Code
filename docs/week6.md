###Deliverables:
* Read Chapter 2: Forces 
* Do exercises from 2.
* Add forces into your creature project and submit a moving creature (or two) that experiences forces.
* Read Chapter 3, and test out some of the examples, add some sort of oscillation to your ecosystem project, as outlined on page 142.
* Reading: Chapter 7: Emergence from Mitchel Whitelaw Metacreation (in readings folder). Make a research and discovery post researching and discussing an example of emergence in light of the ideas in this chapter. This could either be from an artwork or a real life process.
