#Artifical Life: Virtual Creatures

Early example of explorations of artificial life are the automaton of the 1700s. One of the earliest is the Digesting Duck, which is an automaton in the form of a duck, created by Jacques de Vaucanson in 1739. The mechanical duck appeared to have the ability to eat kernels of grain, and to metabolize and defecate them.

As Simon Norfolk argues here, the philosophical crisis it provoked by the duck was around the question **"If it could perform so many functions that were like life and yet it was a machine, then it begged the question what exactly is life? For the first time with any clarity it raised the important question ‘in what way do humans essentially differ from very complicated machines?’**

Decades later the [Mechanical Turk automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk), a chess playing robot that appeared to be able to win against very skilled human players, provoked a related question of human versus machine intelligence. Only later it was found out that its maker,  Wolfgang von Kempelen, has designed it with a secret compartment inside, where he would pay retired grand master chess players to hide and play against oponents, controlling pieces using levers to move pieces around. Amazon has very cynically named their online labour service MTurk in reference to this history.
