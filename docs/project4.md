## Assignment 4  
Final Project  
*Due Week 14*  

The final project in this class is an open brief. Devise an artwork that is to build in the p5js environment and that explores an idea relating to one of the threads we have examined in class so far. This might be a project exploring that face as an interface, a generative system, a game, a very simple live web project using web sockets or something else completely different such as a data visualization using a data stream. 

Your project should aim to create a evocative or compelling experience for your audience or it should be an exploration of a question that you have devised. Your project must be submitted in one of the following ways:
- Upload a zipped folder of your p5js sketch to the Moodle drop box. This folder should contain all the code for your project and a pdf page with your project title, a 200 word description describing your work and references to other artist works that have influenced you or code examples or templates that you may have used in the process.Your code should be formatted correctedly with comments. 

- Upload your p5js sketch to your own github repository including a README.md file. Your README.md should have your project title with the 200 word description and references as described above. All code files should be included in the repository and should be formatted correctedly with comments. Send me a link to the repository online. 

- If you are choosing to do a live web project, your project should also be hosted on Heroku and a link should be included in your project description.
